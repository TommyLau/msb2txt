# msb2txt

A tool for extracting and converting text data from MSB files from Mages engine games, with specific support for the "Famicom Detective Club" game from Nintendo Switch.

## About

This repository contains tools for working with MSB file formats from Nintendo systems. The primary tool `msb2txt.py` parses MSB files and extracts the text content using the game's character set.

## Usage

Run the script with Python:

```
python msb2txt.py path/to/file.msb
```

Optional arguments:
```
-f, --font     Specify a custom font data file (default: font.txt)
-o, --output   Specify a custom output file (default: same name as input with .txt extension)
```

Example:
```
python msb2txt.py --font custom_font.txt --output dialog.txt game/script/scene01.msb
```

## Files

- `msb2txt.py`: Python script that parses MSB files and extracts text using the font data
- `font.txt`: Character set data extracted from the original "Famicom Detective Club" game from Nintendo Switch. This file contains the complete character set used in the game, including Japanese characters, ASCII symbols, and various special characters.

## How It Works

The script extracts text from MSB files by:
1. Reading the MSB file header to find the text offset
2. Parsing the binary data from the text offset
3. Interpreting bytes according to Mages engine format:
   - Bytes â‰¥ 0x80 are treated as characters (16-bit big-endian values)
   - Bytes < 0x80 are treated as commands (like character names, ruby text, etc.)
4. Mapping character codes to actual characters using the font data (by subtracting 0x8000)
5. Outputting the extracted text to a file

## Supported Commands

The script recognizes the following command codes in the MSB files:

- 0x01: CharacterName - Indicates the speaking character's name
- 0x02: DialogueLine - Indicates a line of dialogue
- 0x09: RubyBase - Base text for furigana/ruby annotations
- 0x0A: RubyTextStart - Start of ruby text
- 0x0B: RubyTextEnd - End of ruby text
- 0x03FF: End - End of text segment
